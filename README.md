# Seraphim

## Description

This semester, I would like to build Seraphim, a web application designed to empower users by enabling them to express their creativity and showcase their interests, including music tastes, art, TV shows, movies, animations, styles, subcultures, and personal experiences.

Seraphim seeks to address the need for a supportive and secure online space where individuals, especially women and minority groups, can connect with others and customize their profiles to reflect their unique identities. The application solves the problem of online harassment and objectification by providing a platform where users can freely share their thoughts and experiences without fear of being belittled or targeted.

In a digital age where online interactions can be filled with negativity, harassment, and offensiveness, Seraphim aims to create a positive community where everyone can confidently and authentically express themselves. By focusing on security, support, and users, Seraphim ensures that everyone will have a space where they feel valued and respected.

The target audience for Seraphim is creative people who want to showcase their uncensored selves online without having to deal with objectification, harassment, negativity, or trolls. This includes women, men, and others of appropriate ages, creative individuals and hobbyists like artists, video creators, directors, fashion designers, singers, bakers, writers, etc., and community-seekers like those heavily involved in fandoms/fanbases.

## Product Vision Statement

Seraphim is a creative social platform designed to foster authentic self-expression and connection in a supportive, secure environment. We envision a digital space where users can confidently share their creativity and interests—be it music, fashion, art, or personal anecdotes—without fear of harassment, objectification, or negativity. Our MVP will enable thorough profile customization, robust safety features, creative showcasing through blogging, and genuine interaction through unique communities and direct messaging. Seraphim aims to cultivate a positive online community where each individual is valued and respected, empowering users to express their true selves freely.
